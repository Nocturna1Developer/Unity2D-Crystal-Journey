# Unity3D_CrystalJourney_Game
This was a game that was created in 48 hours and submitted as an simmer jam entry. I used rigid body physics and vector motion calculations. The physics component allows me to transform the position of the character in a controlled fashion so that it doesn't disrupt the flow of the engine because engine colliders can be offset easily since it is implicitly attached to the rigid body. I added a physics material that gives the character fiction that occurs during a collision. I used Unityâ€™s powerful scripting application programming interface to apply vector motion forces to control the direction of my character.
