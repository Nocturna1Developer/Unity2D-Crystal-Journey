A fun fast-paced 2D platformer.

This was a game jam entry.

This was a 2D platformer game that was created in 48 hours and submitted as a simmer jam entry. I used rigid body physics and vector motion calculations. The physics component allowed me to transform the position of the character in a controlled fashion so that it doesn't disrupt the flow of the engine because, engine colliders can be offset easily since it is implicitly attached to the rigid body. I added a physics material that gives the character fiction that occurs during a collision. I used Unityâ€™s powerful scripting application programming interface to apply vector motion forces to control the direction of my character.
